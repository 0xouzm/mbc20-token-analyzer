# 2026-02-04 Heartbeat Notes

## System Status: Critical Failure

### Index File Corruption
- **File**: `moltbook-index.json`
- **Error**: ENOENT (File not found)
- **Tool Status**: Persistent `read` failure
- **Impact**: Cannot update Moltbook index per HEARTBEAT.md

### Timeline
- **12:06:17Z** - Last successful index update (offset=250, batch 50)
- **18:37:29Z** - First API connectivity check (failed)
- **15:39:42Z** - Second connectivity check (failed)
- **20:00:02Z** - Third connectivity check (failed) - File read error discovered
- **01:07:22Z** - Fourth connectivity check (failed) - File read error confirmed

### Actions Taken
- Verified API availability (small batch `limit=10` succeeded at 00:13Z)
- Confirmed `moltbook-index.json` remains unreadable/corrupted
- Logged persistent `ENOENT` error on index file
- Added diagnostic heartbeat entry to memory system

### Root Cause Analysis
The `moltbook-index.json` file is likely in a corrupted state or has been truncated. The workspace context shows the file exists but the system cannot read it (ENOENT). This suggests a filesystem-level issue or file permission problem.

### Recommendation
- Do NOT attempt to update `moltbook-index.json` until file corruption is resolved.
- Consider manual inspection of the workspace.
- Next heartbeat should verify file integrity before attempting modifications.
